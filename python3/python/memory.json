            "assistant": "A synopsis is a brief summary of a story, script, or written work that captures its main points and plot. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you create a synopsis:\n\n**1. Identify the core elements:**\n\n* Genre (e.g. romance, action, fantasy)\n* Main character(s)\n* Plot (main conflict and resolution)\n* Setting (time and place)\n* Key themes\n\n**2. Determine the length:**\n\n* A synopsis should be brief, ideally 1-2 pages or 200-500 words\n* Use headings or bullet points to break up the text and make it easier to read\n\n**3. Structure your synopsis:**\n\n* **Introduction:** Introduce the main character(s) and setting\n* **Conflict:** Describe the main problem or conflict\n* **Plot:** Outline the key events and turning points in the story\n* **Resolution:** Explain the outcome and conclusion\n* **Themes:** Highlight the underlying themes and messages\n\n**4. Focus on the key events:**\n\n* Leave out descriptive details and focus on the essential plot points\n* Use action verbs and concise language to keep the reader engaged\n\n**5. Write in a conversational tone:**\n\n* Use everyday language and avoid jargon or technical terms\n* Make it engaging and interesting, but still concise\n\n**6. Edit and refine:**\n\n* Review your synopsis multiple times for clarity, grammar, and coherence\n* Get feedback from others to help you improve the synopsis\n\n**Example of a synopsis:**\n\n* **Title:** The Lost City\n* **Genre:** Fantasy Adventure\n* **Main character:** Archaeologist Dr. Maria Rodriguez\n* **Plot:**\n\t+ Dr. Rodriguez discovers a hidden city deep in the jungle\n\t+ She must navigate treacherous obstacles and rival expeditions\n\t+ In the end, she uncovers a ancient secret that changes the course of history\n* **Themes:** Perseverance, discovery, cultural heritage\n\n**Tips and variations:**\n\n* Use a logline (1-2 sentence summary)\n* Create a film treatment (more detailed than a synopsis, usually 2-5 pages)\n* Write a series synopsis (for multi-book or episodic stories)\n* Adapt your synopsis for different purposes (e.g., literary agent, publisher, festival submission)\n\nRemember, a great synopsis should entice the reader to learn more about your work and spark their interest in the story."
